# XScreeps
This is an extension to most of Screeps' classes, an assortement of shorthands to make coding easier.

## Installation
Copy all files from the `Assets` folder into your script's folder. Add `require("X");` at the top of your `main.js` to automatically require everything.

The different extensions aren't dependant on each other, so you are able to cherry-pick the ones you want. Howver you'll need to remove the missing modules from `X.js`, or manually `require` each of the modules you picked.
